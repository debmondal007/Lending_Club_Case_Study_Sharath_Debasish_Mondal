General Information
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about past loan applicants and their loan repayment behavior to identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of default.
The business problem being addressed is minimizing credit loss by identifying risky loan applicants and taking appropriate actions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or lending at a higher interest rate.
The dataset consists of various consumer attributes and loan attributes, including demographic information, financial history, loan amount, interest rate, and loan repayment status (Fully paid, Current, or Charged-off).
